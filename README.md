## About the Video Course
In the recent years â€“ the term BigData has been gaining popularity. And there has been a paradigm shift in the volume of information and the ways in which it can be extracted from this data. ELK is one of the few new-age frameworks which is capable of handling Big Data demands and scale. Over the years the ELK stack has become quite popular. And for a good reason. It is a very robust, mature and feature rich framework. ELK is used by large enterprises, government organizations and startups alike. The ELK stack has a very rich and active community behind it. They develop, share and support tons of source code, components, plugins and knowledge about these tools freely and openly. Imagine a large organization, which has information coming in from varied sources, at varied frequencies, and in various formats. It will be a herculean task to sort and sift through this data and normalize it to use for any comprehensive analysis. We will need a pretty versatile and flexible tool to deal with all these permutations of data streams. In this course, we will focus on one such enterprise data collection and collation tool-The LogStash which is one of the core components of the ELK stack. We will look at the overview and explore the technology that goes behind this tool.
